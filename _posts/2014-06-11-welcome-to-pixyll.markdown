Hello.

Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

It's pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast to make a statement, on all devices.

    Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
    yani...
    Mükemmeliyet, ekleyecek birşey kalmadığında değil, çıkartılacak bir şey kalmadığında elde edilir.
